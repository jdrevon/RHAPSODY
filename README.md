TO DO ROADMAP and incoming new features:

- User Documentation
- Custom Intensity Profile provided by the user
- Introduce inclination and position angle in RHAPSODY 
- Take the final intensity profile as initial guess for the next wavelengths inside the parallelization
- Optimize the fitting using MCMC
